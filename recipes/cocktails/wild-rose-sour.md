title: Wild Rose Sour
description: A fruity and floral tequila sour made with reposado tequila, lime, strawberry, and rose.
summary: >
    The Wild Rose Sour is a refreshing riff on a Tommy's Margarita, swapping out the agave syrup for a homemade strawberry rose syrup. This twist adds a subtle sweetness and floral note, perfectly balancing the tartness of the lime and enhancing the smooth, rich flavor of reposado tequila.

## Preparation

Fill a tumbler with ice.

## Assembling the Drink

Put a scoop of ice into a cocktail shaker and add cocktail ingredients. Shake vigorously for 20 seconds. Strain into the tumbler. Garnish with a lime wheel.

## Strawberry Rose Syrup

In a pot, bring water to a boil and add strawberries and rose buds. Cover and let simmer for 15 minutes.  Remove from heat and strain and discard the strawberries and rose buds from the water. 

Add the water back to the pot on low heat and add the agave syrup. Gently stir until fully disolved then remove from heat and let cool. 

Store in an air-tight container and keep refrigerated.
