summary: >
    A twist on the classic Manhattan, this version strikes a balance with equal parts rye whiskey and sweet vermouth. Smooth and slightly less intense, it delivers a mellow sweetness with just the right amount of spice from the rye. Perfect for those who prefer a more approachable yet still bold cocktail.
